# Disaster Management System API Contract

**Purpose:** the single source of truth for how every endpoint in this project looks — the shape of a request, the shape of a response, and what each status code means here. Client code is written against this document, not against whichever server behavior happens to exist yet. If a real endpoint disagrees with this document, the endpoint is wrong.

This contract covers the auth, upload and areas endpoints in full. New endpoints are added under these same conventions — they get their own sections when specified, not their own rules.

---

## 1. Base URL and routing conventions

- All endpoints are mounted under `/api`.
- Resources are **plural, lowercase, hyphenated**: `/api/uploads`, `/api/items`, `/api/item-categories`.
- Auth is not a CRUD resource, so its routes are actions under `/api/auth/<action>`: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`.
- Nesting reflects ownership, not just relation, e.g. `/api/items/:itemId/comments`.

### HTTP methods

| Method | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GET` | Retrieve one resource or a collection. Never changes state. |
| `POST` | Create a new resource, or perform an action that isn't a resource CRUD op (`login`, `refresh`, `logout`). |
| `PUT` | Replace a resource in full. |
| `PATCH` | Update part of a resource. |
| `DELETE` | Remove a resource. |

---

## 2. Success response envelope

Every successful response — regardless of endpoint — returns the same outer shape. The payload lives under `data`.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { }
}
```

`data` holds whatever is appropriate to the endpoint: an object, an array, or `null` for actions with nothing to return (e.g. logout).

**Example** — `GET /api/auth/me`:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "64f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1",
      "name": "Nimal Perera",
      "email": "citizen@example.test",
      "role": "citizen",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-01T09:15:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 3. Error response envelope

Every error response — regardless of cause — returns the same outer shape:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed.",
    "errors": [
      { "field": "email", "message": "must be a valid email address" }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `code` — a fixed, machine-readable string the client can branch on (e.g. show a specific message, redirect to login). Not the HTTP status text — a project-specific code.
- `message` — a human-readable summary, safe to show in a toast if no field-level detail applies.
- `errors` — **optional**. Present only for field-level validation failures (`400`). An array of `{ field, message }`, one entry per invalid field. Omitted entirely for errors that aren't about field validation (auth failures, not-found, conflicts, server errors).

### Error codes in use

| Code | Used for |
|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Request body/params/query failed schema validation. |
| `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | Login email/password combination doesn't match. |
| `ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED` | `POST /api/auth/login` with correct credentials for a deactivated account (§5.2). Always `403`, and deliberately distinguishable from `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` — the caller has already proven they hold the right credentials. `requireAuth` refuses a deactivated user's still-valid access token too (§5.8), but reuses `TOKEN_INVALID` for that rather than this code. |
| `INVALID_CURRENT_PASSWORD` | `POST /api/auth/change-password` called with a `currentPassword` that doesn't match the stored hash. Always `401`, distinguishable from `TOKEN_EXPIRED`/`TOKEN_INVALID` so the client shows a field error instead of re-authenticating. |
| `PASSWORD_UNCHANGED` | `POST /api/auth/change-password` called with a `newPassword` identical to the current password. Always `400`. |
| `RESET_TOKEN_INVALID` | `POST /api/auth/reset-password` (§5.10) with a token that's expired, already used, unknown or malformed. Always `400`, and deliberately the same code and message for all four cases — distinguishing them would tell an attacker holding a stale token which state it's in. |
| `EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS` | Register called with an email already in the database. |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | Reached a role check with no authenticated user. |
| `AUTH_HEADER_MISSING` | No `Authorization` header on a request that requires one. |
| `AUTH_HEADER_MALFORMED` | `Authorization` header present but not `Bearer <token>`. |
| `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Access or refresh token is well-formed but expired. |
| `TOKEN_INVALID` | Access token is invalid, or a refresh token doesn't match a known, unrevoked token. |
| `FORBIDDEN` | Authenticated, but the user's role isn't allowed to do this. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | The requested resource doesn't exist. |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unhandled server-side failure. |
| `FILE_MISSING` | An upload request had no file in the fixed field name. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE` | An uploaded file's MIME type isn't PNG, JPG or PDF. |
| `FILE_TYPE_MISMATCH` | An uploaded file's extension doesn't match its reported MIME type. |
| `FILE_TOO_LARGE` | An uploaded file exceeds the 5MB limit. |
| `STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE` | The storage backend (Supabase) failed or was unreachable. Always `502`. |
| `EMAIL_UNAVAILABLE` | The transactional email provider failed or was unreachable while sending. Always `502`. |

New codes may be added for new resources; existing codes are never repurposed for a different meaning.

---

## 4. Status codes in use

| Status | Meaning in this project |
|---|---|
| `200 OK` | Request succeeded. Used for `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, and action-style `POST`s that don't create a resource (`login`, `refresh`, `logout`). |
| `201 Created` | A new resource was created. Used for `register` and every resource-creating `POST`. |
| `400 Bad Request` | Validation failed — the request body/params/query didn't match the expected shape. Always carries `errors`. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Not authenticated: missing/invalid/expired token, or (for login) wrong credentials. |
| `403 Forbidden` | Authenticated, but the user's role doesn't permit this action. |
| `404 Not Found` | The resource, or the route, doesn't exist. |
| `409 Conflict` | The request conflicts with existing state — e.g. registering an email that's already taken. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | Unhandled failure on the server. Never leaks stack traces or internals to the client in production. |
| `502 Bad Gateway` | A dependency the server calls out to (e.g. Supabase Storage) failed or was unreachable. Distinguishes "the thing you sent was fine but our infrastructure isn't" from a `400`/`500`. |

---

## 5. Auth endpoints

All request/response bodies below are the JSON that goes inside the envelopes from sections 2 and 3 — i.e. a success example shows what fills `data`, and a failure example shows what fills `error`.

Tokens: `accessToken` is short-lived and sent in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on subsequent requests. `refreshToken` is longer-lived, stored in `expo-secure-store` client-side, and used only against `/api/auth/refresh`. The officer web portal (`web/`) keeps both tokens in `localStorage` instead.

### 5.1 Register — `POST /api/auth/register`

Creates a new user account.

**Request body**

```json
{
  "name": "Nimal Perera",
  "email": "citizen@example.test",
  "password": "Password123!",
  "role": "citizen"
}
```

`name` is required: trimmed, at most 100 characters.

`role` must be one of the self-registrable roles, `"citizen"` or `"community_volunteer"`. Any other value — including the four seeded roles below — fails with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` on `role`. Seeded accounts are created only by the seed script or by direct database access — see `server/README.md`.

| Role | Created by | Client |
|---|---|---|
| `citizen` | This endpoint | Mobile app |
| `community_volunteer` — a kind of citizen | This endpoint | Mobile app |
| `rescue_team_lead` | Seed script | Mobile app |
| `dmc_officer` | Seed script | Web portal |
| `duty_officer` — a kind of DMC officer | Seed script | Web portal |
| `district_officer` | Seed script | Web portal |

The API doesn't check which client a request comes from — the Client column is where each role is meant to sign in. The mobile app stops officer roles, and any role it doesn't know, at a wrong-platform screen.

**Success — `201 Created`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "64f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1",
      "name": "Nimal Perera",
      "email": "citizen@example.test",
      "role": "citizen",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-01T09:15:00.000Z"
    },
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOi...",
    "refreshToken": "8f14e45fceea167a5a36..."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `400 Bad Request`** (validation, e.g. missing password or invalid email)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed.",
    "errors": [
      { "field": "password", "message": "must be at least 8 characters" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Failure — `409 Conflict`** (duplicate email)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS",
    "message": "An account with this email already exists."
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Login — `POST /api/auth/login`

**Request body**

```json
{
  "email": "citizen@example.test",
  "password": "Password123!"
}
```

**Success — `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "64f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1",
      "name": "Nimal Perera",
      "email": "citizen@example.test",
      "role": "citizen",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-01T09:15:00.000Z"
    },
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOi...",
    "refreshToken": "8f14e45fceea167a5a36..."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** (wrong password, or email not found — same response either way, so the client can't enumerate accounts)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
    "message": "Email or password is incorrect."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `403 Forbidden`** (correct credentials, but the account has been deactivated — deliberately distinguishable from a wrong password, since the enumeration rule above only protects unknown accounts)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED",
    "message": "This account has been deactivated."
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Refresh — `POST /api/auth/refresh`

Exchanges a valid refresh token for a new access/refresh pair (rotation — the old refresh token is revoked).

**Request body**

```json
{
  "refreshToken": "8f14e45fceea167a5a36..."
}
```

**Success — `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOi...",
    "refreshToken": "3a5f8c1d9b2e04f6..."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** (expired)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "TOKEN_EXPIRED",
    "message": "Refresh token has expired. Please log in again."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** (unknown or already-revoked token)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "TOKEN_INVALID",
    "message": "Refresh token is invalid."
  }
}
```

### 5.4 Logout — `POST /api/auth/logout`

Revokes a refresh token so it can no longer be used. Requires a valid access token (`Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`).

**Request body**

```json
{
  "refreshToken": "8f14e45fceea167a5a36..."
}
```

**Success — `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": null
}
```

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** (no/invalid/expired access token)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHENTICATED",
    "message": "You must be logged in to do this."
  }
}
```

### 5.5 Current user — `GET /api/auth/me`

Returns the authenticated user. Requires `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`.

**Request body:** none.

**Success — `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "64f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1",
      "name": "Nimal Perera",
      "email": "citizen@example.test",
      "role": "citizen",
      "createdAt": "2026-08-01T09:15:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.6 Change password — `POST /api/auth/change-password`

Changes the authenticated user's password. Requires `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`.

On success, every refresh token belonging to the user is revoked and a fresh access/refresh pair is issued — the caller stays signed in on this device with the returned pair; every other device is signed out at its next `/api/auth/refresh` call.

**Request body**

```json
{
  "currentPassword": "Password123!",
  "newPassword": "NewPassword456!"
}
```

**Success — `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOi...",
    "refreshToken": "3a5f8c1d9b2e04f6..."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** (no/invalid/expired access token — same codes as §5.5)

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** (`currentPassword` doesn't match the stored hash)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_CURRENT_PASSWORD",
    "message": "Current password is incorrect."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `400 Bad Request`** (`newPassword` shorter than the minimum registration enforces)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed.",
    "errors": [
      { "field": "newPassword", "message": "must be at least 8 characters" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Failure — `400 Bad Request`** (`newPassword` identical to `currentPassword`)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "PASSWORD_UNCHANGED",
    "message": "New password must be different from your current password."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** (no/invalid/expired access token)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHENTICATED",
    "message": "You must be logged in to do this."
  }
}
```

### 5.7 Deactivate account — `POST /api/auth/deactivate`

Deactivates the authenticated caller's own account. Requires `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. There is no request body and no id parameter — a caller can only ever deactivate their own account.

Sets `isActive` to `false` and revokes every refresh token belonging to the user, signing every device out immediately — there is no session to preserve, unlike §5.6, because the account is going away. Deactivation never deletes anything: the user's existing data is left exactly as it is, and nothing is anonymised.

**Request body:** none.

**Success — `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": null
}
```

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** (no/invalid/expired access token — same codes as §5.5)

### 5.8 Authentication middleware

`server/src/middleware/AuthMiddleware.js` provides three middleware, as methods of its shared `authMiddleware` instance:

- **`requireAuth`** — rejects. No token, a malformed header, an expired token, an invalid/tampered token, a token whose user no longer exists, or a token whose user has since been deactivated each 401 with one of `AUTH_HEADER_MISSING`, `AUTH_HEADER_MALFORMED`, `TOKEN_EXPIRED`, `TOKEN_INVALID`. The deactivated case reuses `TOKEN_INVALID` rather than `ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED` (§3) — that code is reserved for the login refusal (§5.2), and the user is reloaded from the database rather than trusted from the token's claim so this catches an access token minted before deactivation and still inside its expiry window. A valid token loads the user from the database and sets `req.user`. Used on every endpoint that requires a signed-in caller.
- **`optionalAuth`** — never rejects. A valid token sets `req.user` exactly as `requireAuth` does. Every other case — no header, a malformed header, an expired token, an invalid/tampered token, or a token whose user no longer exists — leaves `req.user` undefined and calls `next()` with no error. For a public endpoint that wants to know who's asking without requiring anyone to be. No endpoint uses it yet; `server/tests/integration/auth.optional.test.js` covers it on a probe route.
- **`requireRole(...roles)`** — placed after `requireAuth` or `optionalAuth`. Admits a listed role and every role that inherits from one: `requireRole('citizen')` also admits a `community_volunteer`, and `requireRole('dmc_officer')` also admits a `duty_officer` — never the other way round. Fails closed: `401 UNAUTHENTICATED` if `req.user` is absent, `403 FORBIDDEN` if the user's role is neither listed nor inherits from a listed role (including a role the server no longer knows). An unknown role name passed to `requireRole` throws when the route is declared.

### 5.9 Forgot password — `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`

Requests a password reset link for the given email. No `Authorization` header — a locked-out user has none.

**Always returns `200` with the same body** whether the address matches an active account, a deactivated account, or no account at all — the same anti-enumeration rule login already follows (§5.2). When the address matches an active account, a reset email is sent through the transactional email provider carrying a single-use link that expires after **thirty minutes**. A deactivated account receives no email — deactivation means the account cannot be signed into, and a reset must not be a way around that. Requesting again before an earlier link is used invalidates it, so only the most recent link for an account ever works.

**Request body**

```json
{
  "email": "citizen@example.test"
}
```

**Success — `200 OK`** (identical regardless of whether the address matches an account)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "If that email is registered, a password reset link has been sent."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `400 Bad Request`** (`email` missing or not a valid address)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed.",
    "errors": [
      { "field": "email", "message": "must be a valid email" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5.10 Reset password — `POST /api/auth/reset-password`

Sets a new password from a reset link's token. No `Authorization` header — the person resetting isn't signed in anywhere.

On success, marks the token used, sets the new password, and revokes **every** refresh token belonging to the account — not every other, unlike §5.6, because there is no acting session here to preserve. Returns a success envelope only; it does not sign the caller in or issue a token pair, the client routes to Login.

An expired, already-used, unknown or malformed token all return the same `400 RESET_TOKEN_INVALID` refusal with the same message — distinguishing "expired" from "already used" would tell an attacker holding a stale token which state it's in, and the user's remedy is identical either way: request a new link.

**Request body**

```json
{
  "token": "3f9a1c7e2b...",
  "newPassword": "NewPassword456!"
}
```

**Success — `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": null
}
```

**Failure — `400 Bad Request`** (token expired, already used, unknown or malformed)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "RESET_TOKEN_INVALID",
    "message": "This reset link is invalid or has expired. Request a new one."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `400 Bad Request`** (`newPassword` shorter than the minimum registration enforces)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed.",
    "errors": [
      { "field": "newPassword", "message": "must be at least 8 characters" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 6. Upload endpoint

Stores a file in Supabase Storage and returns its public URL. The client never talks to Supabase directly, only to this endpoint.

### 6.1 Upload a file — `POST /api/uploads`

**Request:** `multipart/form-data`, not JSON.

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `file` | **Required.** The file itself. PNG, JPG or PDF only, checked against both its MIME type and its extension. Max 5MB. |
| `folder` | **Required.** A closed list of purposes, not a free path — a caller can't write anywhere else in the bucket. Currently `avatars` (profile pictures) and `hazard-reports` (UC02 hazard report photos); a feature that needs another purpose adds it to the list. Every folder shares the same 5MB cap and PNG/JPG/PDF allow-list, whatever the calling screen further restricts client-side. |

**Success — `201 Created`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "url": "https://<project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/<bucket>/avatars/9b1e3f2a-....png"
  }
}
```

The returned name is generated server-side and unguessable — never the filename the client sent, and never derived from the caller's user id.

**Failure — `400 Bad Request`** (bad `folder`, same shape as any other `VALIDATION_ERROR`):

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed.",
    "errors": [
      { "field": "folder", "message": "must be one of [avatars, hazard-reports]" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Failure — `400 Bad Request`** (no file in the `file` field):

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FILE_MISSING",
    "message": "No file was provided."
  }
}
```

**Failure — `400 Bad Request`** (wrong type, mismatched extension, or oversize) — see 6.2 for the three distinct codes.

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** — no, malformed, expired or invalid access token; see 6.2 for the codes. Guests cannot upload.

**Failure — `502 Bad Gateway`** (Supabase is down or rejects the request):

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE",
    "message": "Could not upload the file. Please try again."
  }
}
```

A `502` means the file itself may have been fine — try again. A `400` means the file or request was the problem — retrying unchanged won't help.

### 6.2 Error codes for this endpoint

| Status | Code | When |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | `folder` missing or not in the closed list (`avatars`, `hazard-reports`). Carries `errors`. |
| `400` | `FILE_MISSING` | No file in the `file` field. |
| `400` | `UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE` | File's MIME type isn't PNG, JPG or PDF. |
| `400` | `FILE_TYPE_MISMATCH` | File's extension doesn't match its reported MIME type — catches a renamed file. |
| `400` | `FILE_TOO_LARGE` | File exceeds 5MB. |
| `401` | `AUTH_HEADER_MISSING` | No `Authorization` header. |
| `401` | `AUTH_HEADER_MALFORMED` | Header present but not `Bearer <token>`. |
| `401` | `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Access token expired. |
| `401` | `TOKEN_INVALID` | Access token invalid, or its user no longer exists. |
| `502` | `STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE` | Supabase failed or was unreachable. The request may have been valid — safe to retry. |

## 7. Areas endpoints

The registered geography every feature works "by district" against: the 25 districts of Sri Lanka and the river basins that span them. A district and a river basin are both a **target area** — the thing a hazard warning is aimed at — so every other section refers to them by the `id` these endpoints return (`areaIds`, `districtId`, `districtIds`). No other section defines its own list of districts.

Both endpoints are read-only reference data, seeded by `npm run seed` and never edited through the API. Both require `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`, and admit **every role** — citizens need the district list as much as officers do.

**Request:** no body and no query parameters. The full list is always returned, sorted by `name` ascending, without pagination.

`bounds` is a bounding box, not the district's real outline — an accepted approximation that is only used to work out which district a point falls in. `centroid` is the reference point for distance calculations.

### 7.1 List districts — `GET /api/districts`

**Success — `200 OK`** (two of the 25 districts shown)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "districts": [

        "bounds": { "minLat": 6.98, "maxLat": 7.33, "minLng": 79.82, "maxLng": 80.26 },

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | The district's id. Use this, never `name`, to refer to a district in any request. |
| `name` | string | Unique, e.g. `"Colombo"`. |
| `province` | string | The province it belongs to, e.g. `"Western"`. |
| `centroid` | `{ lat, lng }` | Decimal degrees (WGS 84). |
| `bounds` | `{ minLat, maxLat, minLng, maxLng }` | Decimal degrees (WGS 84). |
| `createdAt`, `updatedAt` | ISO 8601 string | |

### 7.2 List river basins — `GET /api/river-basins`

**Success — `200 OK`** (one basin shown)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "riverBasins": [
      {
        "id": "66f7c1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9a1",
        "name": "Kelani",
        "districts": [
          { "id": "66f7c1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b901", "name": "Colombo" },
          { "id": "66f7c1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b902", "name": "Gampaha" }
        ],
        "createdAt": "2026-09-28T08:00:00.000Z",
        "updatedAt": "2026-09-28T08:00:00.000Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | The basin's id. A basin id is accepted wherever a request takes target areas (`areaIds`), and stands for every district it spans. |
| `name` | string | Unique, e.g. `"Kelani"`. |
| `districts` | `[{ id, name }]` | The districts the basin spans, at least one, sorted by `name`. Each `id` is a district id from §7.1, so a client can show "Kelani (Colombo, Gampaha)" without a second request. |
| `createdAt`, `updatedAt` | ISO 8601 string | |

### 7.3 Error codes for these endpoints

Neither endpoint takes input, so neither can fail validation, and an empty list is `200` with `[]`, not `404`.

| Status | Code | When |
|---|---|---|
| `401` | `AUTH_HEADER_MISSING` | No `Authorization` header. |
| `401` | `AUTH_HEADER_MALFORMED` | Header present but not `Bearer <token>`. |
| `401` | `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Access token expired. |
| `401` | `TOKEN_INVALID` | Access token invalid, or its user no longer exists or has been deactivated. |
| `500` | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unhandled server-side failure, e.g. the database is unreachable. |

**Failure — `401 Unauthorized`** (no `Authorization` header)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "AUTH_HEADER_MISSING",
    "message": "Authorization header is missing."
  }
}
```

## 8. Adding a new endpoint later

1. Pick a plural, lowercase, hyphenated resource name.
2. Reuse the envelopes in sections 2 and 3 exactly — don't invent a new outer shape.
3. Reuse an existing error `code` if the failure matches one in the table in section 3; add a new row to that table if it genuinely doesn't.
4. Document the endpoint here (method, path, request body, success and failure examples) before implementing it.
